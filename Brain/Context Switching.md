Unlike computers, Humans are faulty and inefficient
We cannot pick up a dropped task easily
It is difficult to retrace your footsteps in attempt to remember something

> Humans have [context-dependent-memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-dependent_memory)

## How am I dealing with this

One such solution is to
- break down tasks into smaller isolated chunks or features
- take natural bmental take between tasks

There is no single absolut solution, but requires a holistic approach to create a healthy and productive working environment

### Time blocking
- block periods of time with the goal of completing a specific task
- help with structuring your day

### Time batching
- doing similar task together in batches reduces context switching
- x block doing task `[a, b, c]`

### Kill notifications
- kill all - any notifications during your deep work block

### Prioritization
- Focus on task with that have the most meaningful impact

### Eat the Frog

- productivity book on procrastitating
- tackling the biggest task in each morning
- *forg* is the metaphor for your biggest and most important task
	- eat the *ugliest* one first

### Asynchronous coms
- create a culture of not giving an immediate response to chats
- very team dependent


## Game plan
- Currently I am only tracking my TODOs via a digital medium
- Lets try again now combining with physical TODO list to track my work

### To Review
- [scruminc - multitasking](https://www.scruminc.com/multitasking/)
	- Seems like only talking about the cost of context switching
