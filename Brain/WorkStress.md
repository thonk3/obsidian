I Dont want to be like this forever
its stressful, tired al the time

## Why am I like this recently
I think some of the ADHD symptoms getting out of hand
- Im stuck stress at something I loose focus and look for an escape
- Causeing me to loose time 
- more stres and the cycle repeats

## What I want
- I want to spend more time with my partner
- Making many smal and meaningful memories together in our daily lives
- I want a better work life ballance when we eventually have kids

## What am I working for
- I think my time
