## Intent
- define `1::many` dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
- encapsulate the core component in a `subject abstraction` and the variable components in an `Observer` heirachy
- the `View` part of `MVC`

## Problem

> Large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or monitor requirements are levied
