As of until now the abilities of functions are fairly limited as we have not introduced
- ways to make comparison
- perform different operations depending on the result of comparisons

`Control statements` controls the flow of program's execution based on the result of logical comparisons

## 1.5.1 statements

So far we've seen three kind of statements 
- assignment
- `def`
- `return`
These are not expressions although they contain expressions as components

Rather being **evaluated**, statements are **executed**.
Each statement describes some change to the interpreter state, and executing a statement applies that change.
Hence, executing a **statement** can involve evaluating sub-expressions contained within them

## 1.5.2 Compound statements

Simply its a statement composed of many statements

> but the description makes it seems more than that

## 1.5.3 Defining functions - Local Assignments

variable assignment within the scope of functions

> straight forward

## 1.5.4 Conditional statements

> getting lazy


## 1.5.5 Iterations

## 1.5.6 Testing
