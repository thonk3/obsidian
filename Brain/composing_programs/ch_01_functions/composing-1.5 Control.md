# Control

Introduction to the fun stuff.

As of until now the abilities of functions are fairly limited as we have not introduced ways to make comparison and perform different operations depending on the result of comparisons

Control statement will let us do this

## 1. statements

So far we've seen three kind of statements 
- assignment
- `def`
- `return`
These are not expressions although they contain expressions as components

Rather being **evaluated**, statements are **executed**.
Each statement describes some change to the interpreter state, and executing a statement applies that change.
Hence, executing a **statement** can involve evaluating sub-expressions contained within them

## 2. Compound statements

Simply its a statement composed of many statements

> but the description makes it seems more than that

## 3. Defining functions - Local Assignments

variable assignment within the scope of functions

> straight forward

## 4. Conditional statements

> getting lazy


## 5. Iterations

## 6. Testing
