## course introduction
- basic building blocks
- advanced features
- combining building blocks

## what is angular
- js framework to facilitate the construction of reactive SPA
- dynamic web apps generated by javascript
- This course will be working with `Angular 14`

## CLI Deep dive and trouble shooting 
This just goes through setting up the CLI for working 
For more info on [Angular CLI official documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki)

What you need on your CLI
- NodeJs
- NPM
- Angular-CLI
```
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
npm cache verify
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

Common trouble shoot error
- Takes too long - Windows > Run CLI as admin
- EADDR error (addess in use) - `ng serve --port <anotherPort>`
- Changes not updated - check console for error or update and rerun

## Project Setup and first startup
reccomended starting point of angular is to use the `angular cli`
we dont directly writing `nodejs` but it is to bundle the project

### Creating your first project
`ng new <app-name> --no-strict`
currently `--no-strict` flag will make things abit easier (abit still light on the detail why)

configs: no routing / standard css
> The first section shows through an overview of angular code base after first generated and showing a simple 2 way data binding code
> 
> you've done this before but good to review

## Course Structure

- basics
- components & data binding
- directives
- services & dependency injection
- routing
- observables
- forms
- pipes
- http
- auth
- optimizations & ngmodules
- deployment
- animations & testing

## Course approach

- watch the videos and code side by side
- do extra assignments
- try attemting the features first 
- maybe browse the discord and see 

## Basic project Setup with Bootstrap
basic setup with 
- `ng new <new-project>`
- no routing
- basic css
- `npm i --save bootstrap@3`
- edit `angular.json` import before default `styles.css`
	- check node_modules for path `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css`
	- clean html 
	- clean component

## About the course / Code snapshot
