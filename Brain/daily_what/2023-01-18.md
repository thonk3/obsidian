Kind of disappointed on how I squandled my free time today
Spent most of the day on Factorio when I could have use that time practicing

> - Is it ADHD? or am I using it as an escape

I do not know but I cannot keep this self sabotaging cycle up
- difficult task needs focusing a head
- endulge in distraction
- do the task later, killing my free time
- leads to bad mood, upsetting my partner

> I cannot keep this up

OK Game plan for the upcomming day (you can do it)
- [ ] Review tasks at work for your sprint
	- prio task
- [ ] Complete [[AngMax-05-Components-DataBinding]]
	- review the concept of data binding (you know this in react - just need to review the theory)
- [ ] WorkConfigTask - Properly work through 3 tabs 
- [ ] Ngrx youtube walk through
- [ ] Start on [[AngMax-06-Project Component & DataBinding]]
