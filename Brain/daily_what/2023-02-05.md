# Man what a shitty end of the day

Why do you think this happened
I had plenty of time off but I was not productive
not productive in all sense
- not productive in being a good partner, this includes
	- not helping with cleaning the house
	- not helping with fixing anything broken
	- not helping with maintaining the house
- not productive in improving my knowledge base
	- not learning anything that would be beneficial for my career
	- not learning anything that would be beneficial for the current project
	- not learning anything that would be beneficial to ammend damaged bridge?
- not productive in improving my general self
	- not setting and following a schedule
	- not taking care of my physical health
	- not taking care of my mental health

I guess these things just keeps gradually keep piling up, and piling up
and eventually keeps fucking with my head week in, week out

> I cant go on like this

# How I fix this
## 1. Being a good partner
Help with clearning the house, this includes
- Being more attentive to the pets
- Being more attentive to the kitchen clenliness
	- clear the working room every end of day
	- clear the sink at the end of day 
	- budget to buy tools [[Shopping List]]
		- Bike shed 400 - 600
		- I want to repurpose that dumb hole #TODO 
		- lawn mower - keep it looking nice, this is for my sake
		- fix the fucking shelf
> I like this,
> By achieving this, it would proove that I am able to care and put an effort in to  building a home, our home
> for us, eventually for our family
> I want to be relied on

## 2. Be good at what I do
> I Think I just forgot how much I love what I do
> of how much I love this industry

There is so much wasted potential 
But that is exactly why I am stuck here. I waste my time on instant pleasures instead investing it for the future
I need to 
- Spend time on strengthening my foundational understanding of CS concepts
- Spend time on knowing what the fuck am I doing at work
- Spend time on fixing the burnt bridge with the WOC application
> The only minor problem I have with this is to figgure out what to focus on first #TODO 

## 3. Be a better version on myself everyday
> Ah yes improve iteratively keklmao

I think this is heavily dependent on the other categories
Im stuck in a self sabotaging pattern.

> I consistently fail to accomplish any goal I set out,
> Hence this is making me feel bad
> Hence I spend more time trying to remidiate the problem
> Hence this is taking up sleeping time
> Hence I miss out sleep and feel like shit
> And this cycle repeats, every fucking week, every fucking day

Just fix it

### I need this, for myself, for my partner
...

# Plan

I need to just do good day by day

Lets give that habit chaining a try, with the daily work ==standup== as a trigger (since my sleep is fucked right now)
> Lets achieve this and iterate on it 

Let see how this works
