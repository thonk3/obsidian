# How did we get here
Simply just get good

## Goal
Current study plan is 
> Dont be a liability

That means studying to understand what the fuck am I doing at my job
- Learn the tech stack
- Learn the business
But yes you can still learn tech in general to improve your general knowledge, but because you need the money
> Dont be a liability

Listen to your body, take care of your health
More hours does not mean effective hours
10 min break every 2 hour block
10 pushups every 2 hour block
Timer alarm

### Overall plan
#### Daily
2 hour of Angular - min
#### Weekly
1 Hour of SICP

> I modified this to something more realistic
> The current goal is to start a habitual routine
> more in [[2023-02-05]]

## Prioritize
1. [[Angular Index|Angular]]
2. [[Reactive Programming - ngRx - RxJs]]
